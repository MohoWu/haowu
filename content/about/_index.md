Hello, I'm Moho and welcome to my website. I'm a data scientist by profession and a hobbyist woodworker. I keep this blog to document my personal projects (DIY, woodworking and programming). Hopefully this can help and inspire others as well.

When it comes to coding, [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is always my first tool of choice. If you are interested, this website ([source code](https://github.com/MohoWu/haowu)) is made using the R package [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and hosted on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/mohowu/) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/wumoho).
