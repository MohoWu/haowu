Hello, I'm Hao Wu (武昊). I generally present myself as Moho [^1] in the virtual world as it sounds cool. I'm a data scientist working at [Ricardo Energy & Environment](https://ee.ricardo.com/).I obtained my PhD on [air quality](pdf/PhDThesis_HW_final.pdf) from the School of Chemistry, University of Edinburgh. 

I use R to explore and visualise data. This website is built entirely in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) using the [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package.

In my spare time I'm interested in photography and cooking.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/mohowu/) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/wumoho). 


[^1]: This is actually the Catonese pronunciation of my name.
