Hello, I'm Hao Wu (武昊) and welcome to my website. I'm a data scientist working at [Ricardo Energy & Environment](https://ee.ricardo.com/). I obtained my PhD on [air quality](pdf/PhDThesis_HW_final.pdf) from the School of Chemistry, University of Edinburgh.

I use [R](https://www.r-project.org/) to explore and visualise data. The [source code](https://github.com/MohoWu/haowu) for this website are prepared with the [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package. The website is built and hosted on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

In my spare time I enjoy travelling, photography, videography and eating local food.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/mohowu/) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/wumoho).
