  abstract = {Adverse health effects from exposure to air pollution are a global challenge and of widespread concern. Recent high ambient concentration episodes of air pollutants in European cities highlighted the dynamic nature of human exposure and the gaps in data and knowledge about exposure patterns. In order to support health impact assessment it is essential to develop a better understanding of individual exposure pathways in people's everyday lives by taking account of all environments in which people spend time. Here we describe the development, validation and results of an exposure method applied in a study conducted in Scotland.

A low-cost particle counter based on light-scattering technology \textemdash{} the Dylos 1700 was used. Its performance was validated in comparison with equivalent instruments (TEOM-FDMS) at two national monitoring network sites (R2 = 0.9 at a rural background site, R2 = 0.7 at an urban background site). This validation also provided two functions to convert measured PNCs into calculated particle mass concentrations for direct comparison of concentrations with equivalent monitoring instruments and air quality limit values.

This study also used contextual and time-based activity data to define six microenvironments (MEs) to assess everyday exposure of individuals to short-term PM2.5 concentrations. The Dylos was combined with a GPS receiver to track movement and exposure of individuals across the MEs. Seventeen volunteers collected 35 profiles. Profiles may have a different overall duration and structure with respect to times spent in different MEs and activities undertaken. Results indicate that due to the substantial variability across and between MEs, it is essential to measure near-complete exposure pathways to allow for a comprehensive assessment of the exposure risk a person encounters on a daily basis. Taking into account the information gained through personal exposure measurements, this work demonstrates the added value of data generated by the application of low-cost monitors.},

  abstract = {The aim of this work was to compare the variability in an urban area of fine particles (PM2.5), ultrafine particles (UFP) and black carbon (BC) and to evaluate the relationship between each particle metric and potential factors (local traffic, street topography and synoptic meteorology) contributing to the variability. Concentrations of the three particle metrics were quantified using portable monitors through a combination of mobile and static measurements in the city of Edinburgh, UK. The spatial variability of UFP and BC was large, of similar magnitude and about 3 times higher than the spatial variability of PM0.5-2.5 (the PM size fraction actually quantified in this work). Highest inter-daily variability was observed for PM0.5-2.5, which was approximately 2 times higher than inter-daily variability of BC and UFP. Elevated concentrations of UFP and BC were observed along streets with high traffic volumes whereas PM0.5-2.5 showed less variation between streets and a footpath without road traffic. Both BC and UFP were significantly correlated with traffic counts, while no significant correlation between PM0.5-2.5 and traffic counts was observed. BC was significantly correlated with UFP, with significantly different regression slopes between working days and non-working days implying that the increased number of diesel powered heavy goods vehicles during working days contributed more to BC than to UFP. It is concluded that variations in BC and UFP concentrations were mainly determined by the nearby traffic count and varying background concentrations between days, while variation in PM0.5-2.5 concentration was mainly associated with regional sources. These findings imply the need for different policies for managing human exposure to these different particle components: control of much BC and UFP appears to be manageable at local scale by restricting traffic emissions; however, abatement of PM2.5 requires a more strategic approach, in cooperation with other regions and countries on emissions control to curb long-range transport of PM2.5 precursors.},

  abstract = {Land-use regression (LUR) models are increasingly used to estimate exposure to air pollution in urban areas. An appropriate monitoring network is an important component in the development of a robust LUR model. In this study concentrations of NO2 were simulated by a dispersion model at `virtual' monitoring sites in 54 network designs of varying numbers and types of site, using a 25~km2 area in Edinburgh, UK, as an example location. Separate LUR models were developed for each network. The LUR models were then used to estimate NO2 concentration at all residential addresses, which were evaluated against the dispersion-modelled concentration at these addresses. The improvement in predictive capability of the LUR models was insignificant above $\sim$30 monitoring sites, although more sites tended to yield more precise LUR models. Monitoring networks containing sites located within highly populated areas better estimated NO2 concentrations across all residential locations. LUR models constructed from networks containing more roadside sites better characterised the high end of residential NO2 concentrations but had increased errors when considering the whole range of concentrations. No particular composition of monitoring network resulted in good estimation simultaneously across all residential NO2 concentration and of the highest NO2 levels. This evaluation with dispersion modelling has shown that previous LUR model validation methods may have been optimistic in their assessment of the model's predictive performance at residential locations.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a ubiquitous air pollutant with high concentrations particularly close to main roads. The focus of this study was on possible differences in NO2 concentrations between adult and child heights as a function of different distances from heavily trafficked roads in urban areas. Passive diffusion tubes were used to measure NO2 concentrations at heights of 0.8 m (approximate inhalation height of children and closer to vehicle exhaust height) and 2.0 m (approximate inhalation height of adults) above the ground at a number of locations and over several weeks in the city of Edinburgh, UK. Evidence for significant differences in NO2 between heights was observed up to at least 1.2 m from kerbside of busy roads, with tubes at 0.8 m measuring concentrations 5\textendash{}15 \% (a few $\mu$g m-3) greater than at 2.0 m. The vertical NO2 concentration difference was not observable at distances 2.5 m or greater from the kerbside. Fitting of horizontal transects of NO2 concentrations away from main roads demonstrated the strong influence of wind speed in yielding faster fall-off in NO2 concentration from the roadside, and in near-ground vertical gradient in NO2, and lower background NO2 concentrations. These observations have potential public health implications for differential NO2 exposures between children walking, or in buggies, close to heavily trafficked urban roads compared with adults.},
