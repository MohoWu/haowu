I'm a data science specialist working at [Ricardo Energy & Environment](https://ee.ricardo.com/).
I earned my PhD from the School of Chemistry, University of Edinburgh. 
My [thesis](pdf/PhDThesis_HW_final.pdf) was _Assessing urban air quality through measurements and modelling and its implications for human exposure assessment_, supervised by [Mat Heal](http://www.chem.ed.ac.uk/staff/academic-staff/dr-mathew-heal) and [Stefan Reis](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/staff/stefan-reis). 

I love to use programming to explore and visualise data. [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is the primary software I use to analyse data and to communicate with others. This website is built entirely in RStudio using the [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package.

In my spare time I'm interested in photography (or at least learning about all the latest photography gears). I also enjoy cooking for myself and friends (although not on every single day).
